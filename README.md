## Dataset
- Source: Local agricultural records
- Features: Crop type, rainfall, fertilizer, yield
- Size: 5,000 rows

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Power BI

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Visualization
4. Insight generation

## Key Insights
- Rainfall has a strong impact on yield
- Excess fertilizer reduces output after a threshold

## Conclusion
The analysis provides actionable insights that can help improve farming decisions.
